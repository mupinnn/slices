# Slices

My intention for creating this project is to practice more on CSS and JavaScript (vanilla)
by slicing design into code; also to get my hand dirty with other stuff like:
setting up build tools and bundlers.

## Used Tools

- Webpack v5
- SASS + PostCSS
- Pug
- Babel
- Prettier

I doesn't rule out the possibility to use another transpiler like `swc` or `esbuild`; adding
another template engines such as Nunjucks; or might changing JavaScript to TypeScript.
