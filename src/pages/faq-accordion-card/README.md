## Overview

### The challenge

Accordion is most common pattern in front-end, so it's super great to build it from scratch.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

## My process

### Built with

- Pug
- SCSS + `modern-normalize`
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach
- Webpack v5

### What I learned

I utilizing `<details>` and `<summary>` element to create the accordion/disclosure. Its
the standar/semantic so doesn't need to use `<div>`. The fun part is for I've done it without
JavaScript to open/close each of the faq answers.

### Continued development

Still, day-to-day I'll keep drilling to use better class naming, structure, etc.

### Useful resources

- [The `<details>` element docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
