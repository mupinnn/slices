# Slices

My intention for creating this project is to practice more on CSS and JavaScript (vanilla)
by slicing design into code; also to get my hand dirty with other stuff like:
setting up build tools and bundlers.

## Used Tools

- Webpack v5
- SCSS + PostCSS
- Pug
- Babel
- Prettier
- Plop

I doesn't rule out the possibility to use another transpiler like `swc` or `esbuild`; adding
another template engines such as Nunjucks; or might changing JavaScript to TypeScript. The only exception here is I able to use any CSS library/framework
that doesn't include any JavaScript library (e.g jQuery).

The important things that I should keep in mind is: I'm creating this repo
is to practice more on writing _vanilla_ thing(s), so I'll avoid to use any
CSS library/framework as much as possible.
