## My process

### Built with

- Pug
- SCSS + `modern-normalize`
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach
- Webpack v5

### What I learned

I discovered easyn and simple way to create image overlay without adding empty element,
usually a `div`; using `::after` pseudo-element selector and fit it with the image
container size.

### Continued development

For future projects, I'm still curious and want to dig dive more about flexbox and grid,
creating asymmetrical layout, etc. BEM, and other methodologies packed to my learning
list too!

### Useful resources

- [SASS Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - I really like the `7-1` pattern
  for organizing my SASS files.
