## My process

### Built with

- Pug
- SCSS + `modern-normalize`
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first approach
- Webpack v5

### What I learned

Inlining SVG has more advantage than use it as `<img />`; especially
for icon(s).

### Continued development

I'll keep exploring to get a grasp for better class naming, structure, etc.
